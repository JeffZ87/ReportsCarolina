# Developerâ€™s Note

## Technologies used

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/): quick development cycle with minimal backend code

[JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom): covert HTML String to HTML DOM

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): efficient frontend development with integrated support for website responsiveness

[nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/): easy drafting of email alert message

[googleapis](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides): utilize Google APIs to achieve Email/SMS notification

## Potential Updates

- Fix issue with unique key in generated list
    - Search Result and Watch List are generated list using list.map(), their key value is assigned with their respective class number. Therefore, when search result and watch list shows the same class item, NextJS will throw an error.
    - Potential fixes: remove watch list class item from search result; find an alternative way to dynamically list classes
- Integrate with Firebase for authentication and database
    - Independent course watch lists
- Allow end-user to input email (can be satisfied along with user auth)
    - User defined target Email to send notification to
- Fix bug with partial catalog number as search parameter
    - Search COMP 45, result shows COMP 45 but in reality the underlying course is COMP 455
    
    ![BugScreenShot.png](/BugScreenShot.png)
    
    - searchClass() assigns catalog number based on input param instead of response; this cause catalog number to be mismatched with actual course catalog
- Auto refresh of watchlist when class status changes
    - Not a priority because the case is rare; user donâ€™t leave the website open the entire time.
    - Set up interval GET request
- Error Handling
    - Lack error handling code due to development time constraint
    - Invalid googleapi credential handling
    - Null / request body checking across APIs
- Separate monitoring and notification
    - Course status will not be updated unless notification is turned on
